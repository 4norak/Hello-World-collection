# The "Hello World!" collection


### What's that f*cking shit?
I was bored and so I collected some programming languages' "Hello World!"'s. 


### What should I do with this collection?
Nothing. If you're bored too, you're welcome to contribute to this repository.


### Current state
This project will be WIP forever. New programming languages - esoteric or not - are published every year; so this
collection will never end.
